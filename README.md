# NextBIN - Ubuntu System Cleaner & Resource Manager

**Status: In Development** ðŸš€

NextBIN is a lightweight yet powerful system utility designed for Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. It offers essential tools for system maintenance, including cleaning cache, uninstalling applications, monitoring battery usage, and optimizing performance with a modern user interface built using **PyQt6**.

## Features (Current Limitations)
NextBIN is still in early development, so its features are currently limited. However, the following functionalities are available:

- **System Cleaner**: Remove browser cache, APT cache, thumbnail cache, and old kernels.
- **Uninstall Manager**: Easily uninstall applications along with their dependencies.
- **Battery Manager**: Monitor battery percentage, terminate high-resource processes, and switch power modes (Battery Saver, Balanced, Performance).
- **Real-time Resource Monitoring**: Similar to `htop`, track CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- **Desktop Integration**: NextBIN installs a desktop shortcut and system icon for quick access.

Future updates will expand these capabilities to include deeper system optimizations and automated cleanup processes.
