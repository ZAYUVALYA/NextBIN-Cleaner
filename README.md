# NextBIN - Ubuntu System Cleaner & Resource Manager

**Status: In Development** ðŸš€

NextBIN is a system utility application designed for Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. It provides an intuitive and powerful way to manage system resources, uninstall applications, monitor battery usage, and optimize performance with a modern user interface built using **PyQt6**.

## Features
- **System Cleaner**: Remove cache, old kernels, and unnecessary files to free up space.
- **Uninstall Manager**: Completely remove installed applications along with leftover files.
- **Battery Manager**: Monitor battery usage, terminate high-resource processes, and switch power modes (Battery Saver, Balanced, Performance).
- **Real-time Resource Monitoring**: Similar to `htop`, track CPU, memory, disk, and power usage in real time.

## ðŸ”§ Installation Guide (Ubuntu)

### **1. Install Dependencies**
Before running NextBIN, install the required dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv power-profiles-daemon tlp
```

Then, install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Run NextBIN Manually**
Since NextBIN is still in development, you need to start it manually:
```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

This will launch the NextBIN UI, allowing you to use the cleaner, uninstall manager, and battery monitoring features.
